<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>
    My name is Scott. I like to build things. I usually use python or wood.
</p>

<p>
    I live in Nashville, am married to a wonderful woman with whom I share a beautiful daughter and love to hike.
</p>

<p>
    I work at Vanderbilt University for the <a href="http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/educationandbrainlab">Education and Brain Science Research Lab</a>. We study reading disabilities in children and I lead the Magnetic Resonance Imaging side of our research. I write lots of little- and medium-sized tools to make our lives easier related to imaging processing &amp; analysis and the production of good science.
