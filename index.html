# Hi.

My name is Scott. I like to build things. I usually use python or wood.

I live in Nashville, am married to a wonderful woman with whom I share a beautiful daughter and love to hike.

I work at Vanderbilt University for the [Education and Brain Science Research Lab](http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/educationandbrainlab). We study reading disabilities in children and I lead the Magnetic Resonance Imaging side of our research. I write lots of little- and medium-sized tools to make our lives easier related to imaging processing & analysis and the production of good science.
