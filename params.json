I usually use python or wood.\r\n\r\nI'm married to a wonderful woman and we've recently made a [gorgeous little girl][wren].\r\n\r\nI work at Vanderbilt University for the [Education and Brain Science Research Lab][ebrl]. I lead the Magnetic Resonance Imaging side of our research. I write lots of little- and medium-sized tools to make our lives easier related to imaging processing, analysis and the production of good science.\r\n\r\n## Projects\r\n\r\n### PyCap\r\n\r\nI designed and maintain a python package for communicating with REDCap projects through the API, [PyCap][pc]. It provides an easy way for external python applications to export and import data to and from REDCap projects. It is the basis for much of what I've managed to do at EBRL.\r\n\r\n### Red-Light\r\n\r\nThe main REDCap web-app is good for the most part but doing ad-hoc searches against projects is terrible. I wrote a small web-app to expedite this process. It works against the REDCap API. There's a live instance at  [Heroku][rl] and you can view the code on [github][rlc].\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nYou can get in touch with me on [github][gh], [twitter][tw], or `scott.s.burns` at google's email domain.\r\n\r\n[tw]: http://twitter.com/scottsburns\r\n[gh]: http://github.com/sburns\r\n[ebrl]: http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/educationandbrainlab/\r\n[wren]: http://twitter.com/wrenburns\r\n[pc]: http://sburns.github.com/PyCap\r\n[rl]: http://red-light.herokuapp.com\r\n[rlc]: http://github.com/sburns/red-light"}
