I will be giving a talk for the Vanerbilt Kennedy Center's Statistical and Methodology Core on Monday, July 22nd at 12:30p in One Magnolia Circle, Rm 241.

The official calendar event is [can be found here](http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/site/newsandevents/calendar/page.aspx?id=3950).

I've given a "beta" version of this talk to a smaller audience at Chris Fonnesbeck's Statistical Computing Series. I will discuss using advanced REDCap interfaces and how they can be leveraged to solve problems commonly faced in research.

Because I'm expecting a very diverse audience, there are no code samples in the talk. I just finished a basic tutorial on using the REDCap API that cand be found [here](http://bit.ly/pycap-tutorial). You can see a very-close-to-the-actual-version of my slides [here](/assets/pdf/20130712-kc-redcap-beta.pdf).

There will be video at some point and I'll post the link somewhere around here.
