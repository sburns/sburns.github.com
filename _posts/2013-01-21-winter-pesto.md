I made my own pesto the other night and am kicking myself for waiting this long to do so:

- a large handful of spinach, chopped coarsely
- 2/3 cup walnuts, preferably roasted
- 2 cloves garlic
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil

Add the garlic, nuts, salt, pepper, and about a third of the spinach to a food processor and pulse to a coarse mix. Add the rest of the spinach (or in batches as much as your processor can handle) and chop. Add the oil in parts and if you have some liquid available (from cooking pasta perhaps) add some now. *Note*, the liquid will assist in chopping so the more liquid, the finer the pesto. A quarter cup makes for a thin pesto.

Toss with pasta, top with good parmesan and enjoy.
