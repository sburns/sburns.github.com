I just finished my talk about advanced REDCap usage at the Kennedy Center. Many thanks to Jenny Gilbert for organizing it.

The fine folks at the Kennedy Center have already [posted the video](http://kc.vanderbilt.edu/site/newsandevents/podcastandvideo/page.aspx?id=4036).

The PDF version of my final slides is [here](/assets/pdf/20130722-kc-redcap-final.pdf).

I think it went over well and I received some nice feedback afterwards. I worked hard to talk less about the exact mechanics of using the API and more about what types of problems we can better solve with the API and Data Entry Triggers.
